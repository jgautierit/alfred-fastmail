Fastmail is a paid email service focused on speed, security, and user privacy, offering email, calendar, and contact management features.
The masked email feature creates unique, disposable email addresses to protect your real address and enhance privacy.
The idea of this workflow is to quickly create disposable email addresses on demand with Alfred.

`Fastmail` + keyword to create the email with a description and copy it directly to the clipboard.
